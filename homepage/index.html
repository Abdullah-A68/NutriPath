            <h2>What Is BMI and Why It Matters for Your Health</h2>
            <p>BMI (Body Mass Index) is a key indicator, a simple calculation of weight relative to height, categorizing you as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese according to WHO standards. Gender differences are crucial: women typically have about 10% more body fat than men at the same BMI, influencing calorie needs and health risks. While a screening tool, BMI helps identify potential health risks like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension linked to weight.</p>
